Git is a distributed version control system enabling users to manage code changes through repositories, commits, branches, cloning, pulling, pushing, merging, pull requests, and remotes, fostering collaboration and efficient code development."

Repository (Repo):
A repository is like a project folder that contains all the files and the history of changes.
You can create a new repository or clone an existing one.

Commit:
A commit is a snapshot of changes made to the code at a specific point in time.
It's a way to save your work and create a point that you can revert to later if needed.

Branch:
A branch is a parallel version of the code. You can create branches to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.
Once changes are tested and complete, they can be merged back into the main branch.

Clone:
Cloning a repository means creating a local copy on your machine. It allows you to work on the code independently.

Pull and Push:
Pull is used to fetch changes from a remote repository to your local machine.
Push is used to upload your local changes to the remote repository.

Merge:
Merging combines changes from different branches. It's often used to integrate features developed in separate branches.

Pull Request (PR):
A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another. It's a common practice for collaboration in team projects.

Remote:
A remote is a version of your repository that is hosted on the internet or another network. GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are popular hosting services.
